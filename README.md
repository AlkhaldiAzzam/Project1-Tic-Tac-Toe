This is a game of tic tac toe starwars style, with score counter and icon changer.

## Technology used:

- I used vanilla javascript, css and html.
- I used some locally stored images and fonts, also some icons.


## Approach:
The main approach to the game is using 2d arrays to make information gathering a bit easy.
And for checking the win conditions i used loops and ternary operators to check each win condition.

## Main features:
- Icon changer.
- Audio for the tics.
